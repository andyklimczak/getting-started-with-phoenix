(Unofficial) Getting Started with Elixir Phoenix

---

Hey, the [article](./article.md) in this repo is meant to be a recreation of the [Getting Started with Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), but for [Elixir Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
All true credit goes to the writer of that Rails guide.
Thank you for creating such an awesome guide.

I created a Phoenix version of the Rails guide because the Rails guide covers the perfect amount of complexity past what is initially created for you using generators, but still keeping the realm of basic behavior.
Because I have referenced the Rails guide a ton when trying to do simple but fundamental things when doing Rails development, I had always wanted a similar guide for Phoenix that I could use as reference.
So this is my attempt at a guide that attempts to match and implements (mostly) the same things as the Rails guide, but in a Phoenix "standard" way.

I intentionally do not use [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) in order to keep things as simple as possible.
I may do this same thing again, but using LiveView (or JSON endpoints) in the future (let me know if that interests you).

The [blog directory](./blog) is the end result of the code from the [article](./article.md) to be used as a reference.

If there are better/simpler ways to do something, please create an issue or PR.
Not only would you help other readers understand Phoenix better, but you'll help me as well.
