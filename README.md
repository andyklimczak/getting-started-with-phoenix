# (Very Unofficial) Getting Started with Elixir Phoenix Guide

## Quick Start

[Read Guide Here](./GUIDE.md)

## Quick Background

Hey, the [guide](./GUIDE.md) in this repo is meant to be a recreation of the [Getting Started with Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), but for [Elixir Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
I very intentionally poach their words for sections when applicable.
All true credit goes to the writer of that Rails guide.
Thank you for creating such an awesome guide.

I created a Phoenix version of the Rails guide because the Rails guide covers the perfect amount of complexity past what is initially created for you using generators, but remaining the realm of basic functionality.
I had always wanted a similar guide for Phoenix that I could use as reference because I have referenced the Rails guide a ton when trying to do simple but fundamental things in Rails (controllers, relations, validations, etc).
So this is my attempt at a guide that I wish I had that attempts to match and implements the same things as the Rails guide, but in Phoenix.

I intentionally do not use [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) in this guide in order to keep things as simple as possible.
I may do this same thing again, but using LiveView (or JSON endpoints) in the future (let me know if that interests you).

The [blog directory](./blog) is the end result of the code from the [guide](./GUIDE.md) to be used as a reference.

If there are better/simpler ways to do something, please create an issue or PR.
You'll help me understand how to write better Phoenix, but others as well.
Thank you!
